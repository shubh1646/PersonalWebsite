  <h4>Infosys Limited India</h4>
  <h5>System Engineer Trainee</h5>
    <li>Studied and completed coding modules of Python , My sql.</li>
  <li>Designed and coded a Hotel booking application Using SAP- ABAP .</li>
  <li>Studied basics of Sales and distribution Module in SAP.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <h4>Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)</h4>
    <h5>Research Assistant</h5>
      <li>Designed and developed a tool which used TV white space band for wireless communication</li>
  <li>Decreased the cost of hardware by 30 % by using Indigenous components</li>
    <li> Tested and analysed the hardware in rural areas of India where there in no Mobile Signals</li>
      <li> Documented the data in ms excel which was collected using Google API.</li>


    </ul>

    <h2>Project Undertaken  🔬⚗️</h2>
    <ul>
      <h4>Football Fixture Using Genetic Algorithm</h4>
      <li>Implemented genetic algorithm to solve a NP-complete problem of sports Fixture Scheduling</li>
      <li>created a scheduler using giving constraints like each team plays 2 matches against each team ,
Each team played 1 match in home ground and 1 at opponent ground</li>
      <li>To optimise my solution I used Parallel Processing to calculate fitness functions and used
HashTable to store the values of the fitness function to improve the running time of my
application</li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <h4>Huffman Encoder</h4>
        <li>Developed a Huffman encoder and evaluated which priority queue structure gives best
performance : 4 -way optimised heap, Binary heap and Pairing Heap. Optimised heap works
faster 25% than any other heap structure.</li>


        </ul>
        <ul>
          <h4>Intelligent Luggage Follower</h4>
          <li>Designed a Intelligent suitcase that followed the user carrying their luggage and following
them at variable speed. This suitcase was being powered by self designed and fabricated a
piezo shoes</li>
          <li>Coded in c and the hardware was made on ardunio uno board , hardware and software were
integrated and tested.</li>
          <li>Project was successfully converted into a working prototype which earned a A+ and also got
published in IEEE “2nd International Conference for Convergence in Technology</li>

          </ul>
